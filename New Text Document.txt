## How to use these extensions

To use the repository, first clone it.

Each of these extensions are their own top-level directory. Each extension has its own short README explaining what
it does.

To use these extensions in Firefox, you should use the most recent release
of Firefox. All extensions should work with Firefox v.65 and above.


## Installing an example

Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging` using the URL bar. Click the [Load Temporary Add-on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cer9EUKegG4)
button and select the `manifest.json` file within the directory of an example extension you'd like to install. Note the video shows selecting the '.js' file instead of 'manifest.json'.
